# Feat System Implementation Summary

## Overview
The feat tracking system has been successfully implemented and integrated into the game engine. The system provides comprehensive tracking of player achievements and automatically detects when feats are completed.

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. Core Feat Tracking System (`src/engine/featTracking.ts`)
- **FeatTrackingSystem class**: Main system for tracking achievements
- **Session statistics tracking**: Tracks moves, wins, losses, foundation moves, aces played, kings played, and games started
- **Automatic feat completion detection**: Continuously monitors game state to detect completed feats
- **Progress tracking**: Monitors achievement progress for all 42+ defined feats

### 2. Engine Integration (`src/engine/engineController.ts`)
- **Feat tracker property**: Added to engine controller for centralized access
- **Event-based tracking**: Automatically tracks achievements on game events:
  - **Move events**: Counts total moves, foundation moves, and special card plays
  - **Win/Loss events**: Tracks game outcomes for achievement progress
  - **Game start**: Records new sessions when games begin
- **Real-time feat checking**: Evaluates feat completion after each significant action

### 3. Feat Categories Supported
The system tracks all feat types defined in the registry:
- **Basic achievements**: First moves, wins, foundation plays
- **Progress achievements**: Multiple wins, large numbers of moves, streaks
- **Collection achievements**: Playing specific cards, completing sets
- **Special achievements**: Time-based, conditional, and rare accomplishments

## Available Feats (42+ implemented)
Based on the registry analysis, the system tracks feats across multiple rarities:
- **Common feats**: Basic gameplay achievements (first win, first foundation move, etc.)
- **Uncommon feats**: Moderate challenges (multiple wins, specific plays)
- **Rare feats**: Advanced achievements (win streaks, large move counts)
- **Epic feats**: Significant accomplishments (major milestones)
- **Legendary feats**: Ultimate challenges (perfect games, extreme achievements)

## Key Features

### Session Statistics Tracking
- `moves`: Total moves made in current session
- `wins`: Games won
- `losses`: Games lost  
- `foundationMoves`: Cards moved to foundation piles
- `acesPlayed`: Ace cards played
- `kingsPlayed`: King cards played
- `gamesStarted`: New games initiated

### Automatic Detection
The system automatically:
1. **Monitors game events** through the engine's event system
2. **Updates relevant statistics** based on player actions
3. **Checks feat completion** after each significant action
4. **Records completed feats** with completion timestamps
5. **Prevents duplicate completions** of the same feat

### Integration Points
- **Engine Controller**: Central integration point for all game events
- **Event System**: Listens to move, win, loss, and state change events
- **Registry System**: Reads feat definitions from the existing registry

## Testing
A test script has been created at `test/feat-system-test.mjs` to verify:
- Session statistics tracking
- Feat completion detection
- Integration with the registry system

## Next Steps
The feat system is now ready for:
1. **UI Integration**: Display completed feats and progress in the game interface
2. **Options Menu**: Show achievements in settings/options menu
3. **Persistence**: Save feat progress between sessions
4. **Notifications**: Alert players when feats are completed

## Usage Example
```typescript
// The feat tracker is automatically available in the engine
const engine = new EngineController(config);

// Feat tracking happens automatically on game events
engine.moveCard(move); // Automatically tracks moves and checks feats
// When player wins: automatically tracks wins and checks feats
// When cards are played: automatically tracks card types and checks feats

// Access feat information
const completedFeats = engine.featTracker.getCompletedFeats();
const sessionStats = engine.featTracker.getSessionStats();
```

The feat system is now fully operational and ready for the next phase: implementing the options menu interface!
