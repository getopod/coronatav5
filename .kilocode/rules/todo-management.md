## Brief overview
  This set of guidelines covers best practices for managing todo lists during development tasks to ensure comprehensive task tracking and prevent forgotten work items.

## Todo list creation
  - Create todo lists for complex tasks involving multiple steps or requiring ongoing tracking
  - Break large tasks into small, manageable subtasks for efficiency
  - Convert every user request into todo list items to ensure nothing is forgotten

## Todo list maintenance
  - Preserve all existing items that are not marked as 'completed'
  - Only mark tasks as completed when fully accomplished with no unresolved issues
  - Append new items to existing lists without clearing, removing, or modifying unfinished items
  - Update progress incrementally as work progresses

## Task completion criteria
  - Mark tasks as completed only when all work is fully finished
  - Ensure no unresolved dependencies remain before marking complete
  - Use clear, descriptive task names that reflect the actual work done

## Progress tracking
  - Use status indicators (pending, in progress, completed) consistently
  - Update todo lists after each significant step or tool use
  - Maintain logical task ordering based on dependencies
