## ðŸŽ¯ Current Balance Analysis

### **Economic Balance: Mostly Solid with Mid-Game Inflation**

**Strengths:**
- Smooth coin flow: 520 total coins per run (50 starting + 520 from encounters)
- Escalating trade costs prevent early-game power spikes
- Meaningful purchasing decisions at each trade window

**Issues Identified:**
- Mid-game coin surplus: Players accumulate 200-300 coins by Trade 3, enabling multiple high-cost purchases
- Legendary exploits (180-250 coins) become accessible too early for skilled players
- No coin sinks beyond trading and curse removal

**Recommendation:** Implement coin interest mechanics or encounter-based spending opportunities

### **Scoring Balance: Good Progression with Power Creep Concerns**

**Strengths:**
- Smooth 25% score growth eliminates difficulty spikes
- Foundation multiplier (2x) encourages strategic play
- Registry effects provide meaningful tactical choices

**Issues Identified:**
- Legendary exploits create overwhelming power disparities:
  - "Everlasting Gambit" (unlimited shuffles) breaks resource management
  - "Sovereign's Edict" (immunity to all fears/dangers) trivializes encounters
  - "Ouroboros" enables infinite card copying
- Some multiplicative effects stack too aggressively

**Recommendation:** Add diminishing returns to stacked multipliers and encounter-based exploit restrictions

### **Registry Balance: Excellent Variety with Rarity Inflation**

**Strengths:**
- 8 distinct categories with clear thematic roles
- Rarity system provides satisfying progression
- Conditional effects encourage strategic thinking

**Issues Identified:**
- Epic/Legendary rarities offer game-breaking power for reasonable costs
- Some effects lack meaningful trade-offs
- Limited counterplay against overpowered combinations

**Recommendation:** Implement synergy limits and encounter-based effect suppression

### **Ascension Balance: Strong Depth with Accessibility Concerns**

**Strengths:**
- 9 difficulty levels provide infinite replayability
- Progressive penalties maintain challenge scaling
- Unique rewards encourage completion

**Issues Identified:**
- Level 9 penalties may be insurmountable for casual players
- Some ascension effects compound too severely
- Limited guidance for optimal ascension strategies

**Recommendation:** Add ascension-specific tutorials and difficulty presets
