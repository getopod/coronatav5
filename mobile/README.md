# React Native Setup

This folder is for the mobile version of Klondike Solitaire using React Native.

## Next Steps
1. Initialize a React Native project here:
   - Run in terminal (from this folder):
     ```
     npx react-native init KlondikeMobile
     ```
2. Share game logic between web and mobile by placing reusable code in a `shared` folder at the project root.
3. Build mobile UI using React Native components.

## Notes
- You can use Expo for easier development and testing, or plain React Native CLI for more control.
- To run on Android/iOS, follow React Native documentation for emulator/device setup.
